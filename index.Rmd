Welcome to my personal website, powered by **R Markdown**! 

## Current Situation
Currently working within the D2AS (Device, Digital, and Alexa Support) as Data Scientist to learn a little more about Natural Language Processing. 

## Background
I've been an Amazonian since 2016. I've also worked within AWS Hardware Engineering where I've had the good fun in deploying a deeper understand in all things R such as writing complex, but pretty cool dplyr statements, R Shiny Dev Ops, and figuring out how to write data driven reporting via R Markdown. I was bored and decided to move my personal site from wordpress to [Github](https://github.com/arifyali/arifyali.github.io) on a long weekend in the middle of COVID-19. 

I've been a member of the [#rstats community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) since 2012 and have enjoyed every minute of it. I received my Masters degree from Georgetown University where I was advised by [Dr. Todd Leen](https://nsf.gov/staff/staff_bio.jsp?lan=tleen&org=HRD&from_org=HRD) and [Dr. Hans Engler](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RhGiAAK/hans-engler).
Prior to Georgetown, I received my Undergraduate Degree from the University of California, Berkeley then worked at SpoonRocket (defunct) and [Greatschools](https://www.greatschools.org/).
