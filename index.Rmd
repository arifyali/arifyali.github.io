Welcome to my personal website, powered by **R Markdown**! 

## Current Situation
Currently working within the D2AS (Device, Digital, and Alexa Support) organization at Amazon as Data Scientist to learn a little more about Natural Language Processing. 

## Background
I've been an Amazonian since 2016. I've also worked within AWS Hardware Engineering where I've had the good fun in developing a deeper understanding of all things R such as writing complex, but pretty cool dplyr statements, R Shiny Dev Ops, and figuring out how to write data driven reporting via R Markdown. I was bored and decided to move my personal site from wordpress to [Github](https://github.com/arifyali/arifyali.github.io) and Google Domains on a long weekend in the middle of COVID-19. 

I've been a member of the [#rstats community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) since 2012 and have enjoyed every minute of it. I received my Master's degree from Georgetown University where I was advised by [Dr. Todd Leen](https://nsf.gov/staff/staff_bio.jsp?lan=tleen&org=HRD&from_org=HRD) and [Dr. Hans Engler](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RhGiAAK/hans-engler).
Prior to Georgetown, I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley where I majored in Statistics and explored Public Policy.

## Outside of Work (COVID-19 Edition)
1. COVID-19 forced me to [become a chef](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODU4OTcxMjY3ODU4MzUy?igshid=3uerk9lpjogt&story_media_id=2281772023078627639). Results are mixed.
1. I got involved in the 2020 election by prototyping a mail-in dropoff tool in [R Shiny](https://arifyali.shinyapps.io/mail-in-ballot-dropoff/) and was able to work with volunteers via [Tech For Campaigns](https://techforcampaigns.org/) to make it a [full blown product](https://medium.com/techforcampaigns/open-sourcing-our-ballot-dropoff-locator-tool-8b4d5ad294c3)!
1. Thinking of all the ways to use my vacation days once COVID is a manageable issue
1. Got into mechanical keyboard building!
1. Zoom workout classes are keeping me sane...


## Interested in Connecting?
I'm always open to connecting and respectfully ask for adherence to the following communication guidelines:

1. Professional/Career Connections, reach out via LinkedIn.
1. Engagement on an interesting topic (like R), reach out via Twitter.
1. Open Source Collaboration, check out my (sparse) Github.
1. Food, dogs, beer, and traveling, go to Instagram!

## All the Places I've Lived!
And a cool way to show off a little {dplyr}.
```{R places I have lived plus R stats fun, echo=FALSE}


m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-97.3308, lat=32.7555, popup="The Birthplace of Me") %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-81.4407, lat=41.2401, popup="Childhood") %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-122.2869, lat=38.2975, popup="High School")  %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-122.2601, lat=37.8712, popup="College")  %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-77.0723, lat=38.9076, popup="Grad School") %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-122.3401951, lat=47.6151, popup="Data Science Life")
