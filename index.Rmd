Welcome to my personal website, powered by **R Markdown**! 

## Current Situation
Currently working within the D2AS (Device, Digital, and Alexa Support) as Data Scientist to learn a little more about Natural Language Processing. 

## Background
I've been an Amazonian since 2016. I've also worked within AWS Hardware Engineering where I've had the good fun in deploying a deeper understand in all things R such as writing complex, but pretty cool dplyr statements, R Shiny Dev Ops, and figuring out how to write data driven reporting via R Markdown. I was bored and decided to move my personal site from wordpress to [Github](https://github.com/arifyali/arifyali.github.io) on a long weekend in the middle of COVID-19. 

I've been a member of the [#rstats community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) since 2012 and have enjoyed every minute of it. I received my Master's degree from Georgetown University where I was advised by [Dr. Todd Leen](https://nsf.gov/staff/staff_bio.jsp?lan=tleen&org=HRD&from_org=HRD) and [Dr. Hans Engler](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RhGiAAK/hans-engler).
Prior to Georgetown, I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley where I majored in Statistics and explored Public Policy.

## Interested in Connecting?
I'm alway open to connecting and respectfully ask for adherence to the following communication guidelines:

1. Professional/Career Connections, reach out via LinkedIn.
1. Engagement on an interesting topic (like R), reach out via Twitter.
1. Open Source Collaboration, Github.
1. Food, dogs, beer, and traveling, Instagram (if you can find it)!

## All the Places I've lived!
And a cool way to show off a little {dplyr}.
```{R places I have lived plus R stats fun, echo=FALSE}


m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-97.3308, lat=32.7555, popup="The Birthplace of Me") %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-81.4407, lat=41.2401, popup="Childhood") %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-122.2869, lat=38.2975, popup="High School")  %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-122.2601, lat=37.8712, popup="College")  %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-77.0723, lat=38.9076, popup="Grad School") %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-122.3401951, lat=47.6151, popup="Data Science Life")
